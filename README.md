# GoLang-Microservices-Playground
The purpose of this software was to test how two independent instances of software actually communicate with each other as I wanted
to better understand how Microservices, message queus, and GO works. 

This communication is done via RabbitMQ and GO. The results are published to the database as messages may need to be retreived at a later time..
